# Covid19_SQL_Project


In this script, I'm setting up a database named "COVID" and making it my active database for the subsequent analysis. First, I check for any missing values in my COVID-19 dataset across various columns, like Province, Country, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered, ensuring the data is complete and consistent. If I find any missing values, I update them to 0. Then, I dive into descriptive statistics, providing a detailed overview of the dataset, including the number of rows, distinct years and months, and key statistics like the minimum, maximum, and total counts of cases per month. I also explore measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode, and calculate dispersion measures such as range, variance, and standard deviation. Additionally, I use percentiles to understand the distribution of data and analyze the top cases for confirmed, deaths, and recoveries. This script is a valuable tool for my data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.
